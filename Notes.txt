My Learnings

express is the web framework that will make setting up the HTTP server and its requests easier.

.listen sets up an HTTP server. Get, POST will require different call back function that can handle the requests specifically.

package.json can hold alias for scripts. Scripts can be to run server.

nodemon can be used to dynamically deploy the changes without needing to restart the server.

NEEDS TO BE STUDIED MORE use async to use keyword 'await'

app.use(express.json()) allows use to user input data as JSON other wise we can't parse the user input data. For example, without this initialization we can't use req.body.name or req.body.price

In product.model.js we create a model, this model interacts with the corresponding collection in MongoDB, if a collection does not exists it will create a new collection.

Database name is provided in the connection string. If the database name provided in the connection string does not exists it will create a new database.


useState in REACT. This is used to store the state, that is user input, which can re-rendered(used again the code).
const [newProduct, setNewProduct] = useState()
newProduct will be used to take new value from input and setNewProduct will used to update the state.

onChange={(e) => setNewProduct({...newProduct, image: e.target.value})}
this will be added to the input field, where onChange is triggered when the user inputs something, e is the event object that passes the value of the user input event to setNewProduct which then uses the existing values of the state and updates the image field value with the user input.
So it will first take name pass it to price, the name,price will be passed to image.
